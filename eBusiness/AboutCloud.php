    <!--Info about salesforce-->
    <p>Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce platform.</p>
    <p>It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for 
    automatically routing and escalating important events.</p> 
    <p>The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking 
    plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about 
    their company on social networking websites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.</p>
    <p>Salesforce.com, Inc. is an American cloud computing company headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
    <p>Though its revenue comes from a customer relationship management (CRM) product, Salesforce also sells commercial applications of social networking through acquisition and internal 
    development.</p>
    <p>As of early 2016, it is one of the most highly valued American cloud computing companies with a market capitalization above $61 billion.</p>
    <p>In August 2017, Salesforce announced that it had reached the $10 billion revenue run rate becoming the first enterprise cloud company to do so. 
    Its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol CRM and is a constituent of the S&P 500 Index</p>

    <!--Info about cloud9-->
    <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) or application platform as a Service (aPaaS) or platform base service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing
    customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app</p>
    <p>PaaS can be delivered in three ways: as a public cloud service from a provider, where the consumer controls software deployment with minimal configuration options, and the provider 
    provides the networks, servers, storage, operating system (OS), middleware (e.g. Java runtime, .NET runtime, integration, etc.), database and other services to host the consumer's
    application; as a private service (software or appliance) inside the firewall; or as software deployed on a public infrastructure as a service.</p>
    <p>The advantages of PaaS are primarily that it allows for higher-level programming with dramatically reduced complexity; the overall development of the application can be more
    effective, as it has built-in infrastructure; and maintenance and enhancement of the application is easier. 
    It can also be useful in situations where multiple developers are working on a single project involving parties who are not located nearby.</p>
    <p>One disadvantage of PaaS offerings is that developers may not be able to use a full range of conventional tools (e.g. relational databases, 
    with unrestricted joins). Another possible disadvantage is being locked in to a certain platform. However, most PaaSes are relatively lock-in free</p>

    <div class="section"  id= "section3">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - Amazon
   
    <p>nfrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
    IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p> 
    <p>Provides users with processing, storage, networks, and other computing infrastructure resources. </p>
    <p>The user does not manage or control the infrastructure, but has control over operating systems, applications, and programming frameworks. </p>
